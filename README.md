# ka-a-KIVA-t: Supporting MSMEs by Strengthening Socially Driven MFIs through Crowdfunded Microfinancing

This is an app that predicts whether or not a loan in KIVA will get funded, based on the user's inputs. The user's inputs are the characteristics of his or her loan. The app will output the result of the prediction, and will give out 5 similar loans that were funded. The user can use the 5 similar loans to better tweak his or her loan to better the chances of getting the loan funded, if it was rejected.

The models for predicting the loan, and getting 5 similar loans are stored here. The app is deployed through Streamlit.
