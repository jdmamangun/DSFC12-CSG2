**ka-a-KIVA-t: Supporting MSMEs by Strengthening Socially Driven MFIs through Crowdfunded Microfinancing**

Micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) stand as the bedrock of emerging economies, playing a vital role in the economic landscape. In the Philippines, a staggering 99% of businesses fall within the MSME category, making substantial contributions to the nation's economic growth. Despite their pivotal role, these enterprises encounter a significant hurdleâ€”limited access to credit. Factors such as poor credit history, insufficient collateral, and the challenges posed by high interest rates and shorter terms contribute to this constraint. In contrast to traditional microfinance, often tethered to large banks with inflexible structures and criticized for profit-driven motives, crowdfunded microfinance emerges as a dynamic alternative. This approach offers flexibility, expedites funding, and caters to the diverse needs of MSMEs. In the intricate workings of Kiva, a crowdfunded microfinancing platform, entrepreneurs receive financial support through a Social Microfinance Institution (MFI). The Social MFI then showcases borrower profiles on the Kiva website, attracting global lenders to fund their loans. However, the reality is that not all loans get funded, with expired loans representing missed opportunities for businesses in dire need of crucial funding.

Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to increase the likelihood of a loan securing a successful crowdfunding campaign on Kiva. This entails formulating recommendations derived from conditions observed in profiles with similar attributes that have previously achieved full funding.

In the analysis of the dataset containing Kiva borrower profiles, a systematic approach was undertaken. First, association and correlation tests were implemented to identify the most influential features affecting loan funding. Next, undersampling techniques were tested to address the imbalanced nature of the dataset, with only 4% representing expired loans. Subsequently, diverse models were hypertuned, and the best model, based on the highest recall score, was selected. Additionally, a recommender engine, utilizing the Nearest Neighbors algorithm, was developed to suggest five similar loans that had successfully garnered crowdfunding. Finally, an application that integrates the predictive model and recommender engine was deployed. Note that the target variable in the predictive model, is_expired, denotes whether a profile is predicted to expire (1) or get fully funded (0). The choice of using recall as the evaluation metric was deliberate, aiming to minimize false negative predictions. This optimization ensures that instances where the predictive model erroneously predicts that a profile will likely be funded when, in fact, it is expected to expire are reduced. The emphasis on reducing false negatives is crucial, as it helps the MFI avoid posting profiles that may not secure full funding.

In conclusion, borrowers with loan amounts ranging from $25 to $250, repayment terms of 15 months, currency loss coverage by lending partners, inclusion of an image, monthly repayment intervals, and affiliation with the retail, food, or agriculture sectors are particularly well-positioned for successful crowdfunding. These key attributes contribute to fostering trust and engagement among potential lenders, thereby increasing the chances of a profile securing full funding. Furthermore, XGBoost emerged as the optimal predictive model, achieving a holdout recall score of 94%; this underscores the reliability of the model in minimizing false negatives, a crucial aspect in the context of predicting loan-funding outcomes on Kiva.
